	<p>Heliospheric Current Sheets, also known as HCS, is loosely defined is a thin layer of plasma that divides two oppositely directed
	global heliospheric magnetic fields originating from the sun. It is believed that the HCS is generated at the cusp of the streamer
	belt and is the interplanetary extension of the solar neutral line. The Heliospheric Current Sheet is the largest and persistent
	solar wind structure that permeates the entire solar system. The HCS can be described as having a warped shape after streching
	out of the sun by solar wind, it is also surrounded by a region of plasma called "The Heliospheric Plasma Sheet(HPS)". HCS can be 
	characterized by having a local maximum in the proton density and a local minimum in proton temperature and speed.
	
	<p>
	This website holds data from the WIND and ACE spacecraft, You will be able to see the data as a table on our Data Table page 
	for both spacecraft. Links in the Data Table page will take you directly to the HCS plot and Carrington Map for each data entry.
	The Data Image page is a gallery of the Carrington Maps for both the ACE and WIND spacecraft, each image is separated by the year.
	Clicking on an image will enlarge it in a blue box in the middle of the screen. To switch between ACE and WIND data there are links 
	at bottom, number 1 is for Ace and 2 is for WIND. On the Data image site I provided two links for both galleries, for your convience 
	you can press the same Tab in the nav to switch as well.
