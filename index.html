	<p>The heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is considered as a heliospheric extension of the solar magnetic equator that divides 
	   the solar magnetic field into inward and outward sectors (a.k.a. sector boundary or SB). Due to the offset of the solar 
	   magnetic pole from the solar rotation axis, the Earth makes two or more (if the HCS is wavy like) crossings of the HCS 
	   during each solar rotation period. The HCS (or SB) is an important marker of geomagnetic disturbances. Providing lists 
	   of the HCS observed from spacecraft not only provides insights into the global heliospheric solar wind structure but 
	   also helps improve space weather forecasting. Being part of a long-term project, this work focuses on building up an 
	   HCS event database and making it available to the community through a website. Mapping of the observed HCS events to 
	   the surface of the Sun will also be performed. 
	
	<p>
	This website holds data from the WIND and ACE spacecraft, You will be able to see the data as a table on our Data Table page 
	for both spacecraft. Links in the Data Table page will take you directly to the HCS plot and Carrington Map for each data entry.
	The Data Image page is a gallery of the Carrington Maps for both the ACE and WIND spacecraft, each image is separated by the year.
	Clicking on an image will enlarge it in a blue box in the middle of the screen. To switch between ACE and WIND data there are links 
	at bottom, number 1 is for Ace and 2 is for WIND. On the Data image site I provided two links for both galleries, for your convience 
	you can press the same Tab in the nav to switch as well.
