# NRL_Website

This is the Nrl Website I am creating for the NRL 2022 Summer internship right now. 
It has three tabs to go through a homepage, Data Table page, and a Data Images page.

The homepage explains a little about the research and desccibes how to use the website.

For the Data Table Page and Data Images Page they have been split between two aircrafts ACE and WIND.
they are linked together on each page 
For the Data Tables page you can use the page number links at the bottom or click the same tab at the top to switch
For the Data images Page you choose between both galleries at the top of the page as well as clicking the same tab in the nav

The Data Tables page has Data for both ACE and WIND in a table format
The wind Data has links in the the table that will take you to the HCS plot or the Carrington map for each data entry 
Both ACE and WIND data tables have a subscript lengend and reference at the bottom of the page 

For the Data images page you can click on any image which is seperated by year, after clicking on a image it will send you a blue box
at the top of the screen which will show the enlarged image

The CRmaps in the repository was a lot so i had to split in to two different folders so make sure after downloading the zip folder moved the continued
CRmaps to the original one to see all the images.

This webpage was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
